Question: How does competitive coexistence and other environmental factors influence species abundance,
and how does that influence the dispersal and type of eDNA found present within the environment?
Approach: By reviewing several literature pieces I will be able to understand and utilize the results of those literature pieces to see how much of role environmental 
factors play a part in influencing the species abundance of an environment. From the data gathered, then I can display how competitive coexistence, seasonal distribution,
spatial distribution, and invasive species can influence the variability and diversity of eDNA present within an environment.
Findings: What I discovered is that the presence of invasive species and the spatial distribution of species within their environment plays a more significant role in the
dispersal and diversity of eDNA within an environment than the seasonal distribution of species, while competitive coexistence role goes hand in hand with the presence of
an invasive species in the influence of the distribution of eDNA.
Obstacles: Some obstacles I ran into while conducting this project was finding a proper way in displaying how each environmental factor influences the dispersal of eDNA.
Another obstacle I ran into was applying the data I gathered into box plots properly but was eventually able to properly display the data with Renataâ€™s guidance.
Next Steps: The next steps for this project would look into more journal articles that utilize eDNA to tract species abundance within an environment to further provide
more resources that support the notion that the presence of invasive species and the spatial distribution of species within their environment plays a more significant
role in the dispersal and diversity of eDNA within an environment than the seasonal distribution of species.
Words of Wisdom: When approaching this project, look into other possible environmental factors such as pollution and movement patterns of prey to see what other factors
can have either a great or little to no influence on the dispersal and distribution of eDNA
Take away From Project: My takeaway from this project is that eDNA can be used to answer several different questions that involve not only the species abundance,
richness, and movement of animals, but also allows us to access the health of an environment by analyzing the distribution of eDNA within that environment and
relate that to previous dispersals and rates of eDNa present in that environment in the past.
