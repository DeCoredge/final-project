## Project Proposal

Name(s) of the folks involved in this project:Me, myself, and I

Working title: How competitive coexistence influence species abundance, and how does that influence the dispersal and type of eDNA found present within the environment

Project summary (1-2 sentences):By reviewing several literature pieces I will be able understand and utilize the results of those literature pieces to see how much of a role competitve coexistence plays a part in influencing the species abundance of an environment. From the data gathered, I can then display how the affect competitve coextistence has on secies abundance will influence the variability and diversity of eDNA present withinthe environment.

What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?: What's interesting to me about this project is to see how competitve coextistence can cause the diversity of an environment to fluctuate through intraspecific interactions.

How do you plan to tackle this project?: By utilizing several literature sources that provide concrete results on how competive coexistence determines the species abundance of an environment and relate the results of that to the prsense of eDNA in a species rich environment compared to a non-rich species environment.

What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?: Competive coexistence

What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12618; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.5379; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/edn3.7; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12598; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-020-01980-0

How can Andy or Renata help?: linking useful literature that relates to the topics of species richness influencing eDNA
